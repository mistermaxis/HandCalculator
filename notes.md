## Notes

- Before moving on with checking double pairs, I should take care of the situation with the pair where the kicker gets assigned the highest non-pair card on the hand. It should instead be assigned as follows:

### If the pair is made with the two pocket cards:

- It shouldn't be assigned (it should be assigned the non-value card).

### If the pair is made with one of the pocket cards:

- The kicker should be assigned the other pocket card.

### If the pair is made with two cards from the table:

- It should be assigned the highest of the two pocket cards.
