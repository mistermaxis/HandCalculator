## Notes

- Before moving on with checking double pairs, I should take care of the situation with the pair where the kicker gets assigned the highest non-pair card on the hand. It should instead be assigned as follows:

### If the pair is made with the \<TWO\> pocket cards:

- It shouldn't be assigned (it should be assigned the non-value card).

### If the pair is made with \<ONE\> of the pocket cards:

- The kicker should be assigned the other pocket card, only if the other pocket card is within the top five cards of the hand. Otherwise it shouldn't be assigned.

### If the pair is made with \<NO\> pocket cards:

- It should be assigned the highest of the two pocket cards, only if the high pocket card is within the top five cards of the hand. Otherwise it shouldn't be assigned.
